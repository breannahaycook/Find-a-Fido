            <h2>Chihuahua</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Chihuahua-Illo-2.jpg" alt="Picture of a Chihuahua">
            <p>The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico,
                these alert and amusing "purse dogs" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas, 
                with a lineage going back to the ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times. 
                The Chihuahua is a balanced, graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor, 
                weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded "apple" head is a breed hallmark. 
                The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many 
                colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat. 
                Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, 
                and without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. 
                Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. 
                They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must be taken in cold weather, 
                but Chihuahuas are adaptable'¿as long as they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap.</p>

            <h2>Poodle</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Standard-Poodle-illustration.jpg" alt="Picture of a Poodle">
            <p>Whether Standard, Miniature, or Toy, and either black, white, or apricot, the Poodle stands proudly 
                among dogdom¿s true aristocrats. Beneath the curly, low-allergen coat is an elegant athlete and 
                companion for all reasons and seasons.</p>
            <p>Poodles come in three size varieties: Standards should be more than 15 inches tall at the shoulder; 
                Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys stand no more than 10 inches. All three varieties have the 
                same build and proportions. At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental 
                clip. Most pet owners prefer the simpler Sporting clip, in which the coat is shorn to follow the 
                outline of the squarely built, smoothly muscled body.  Forget any preconceived notions about 
                Poodles you may have: Poodles are eager, athletic, and wickedly smart dogs of remarkable 
                versatility. The Standard, with his greater size and strength, is the best all-around athlete 
                of the family, but all Poodles can be trained with great success.</p>

            <p>Sleek and powerful, possessing both a magnificent physique and keen intelligence, the Doberman 
                Pinscher is one of dogkind's noblemen. This incomparably fearless and vigilant breed stands 
                proudly among the world's finest protection dogs. Dobermans are compactly built dogs'¿muscular, 
                fast, and powerful'¿standing between 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder. The body is sleek but 
                substantial, and is covered with a glistening coat of black, blue, red, or fawn, with rust 
                markings. These elegant qualities, combined with a noble wedge-shaped head and an easy, 
                athletic way of moving, have earned Dobermans a reputation as royalty in the canine kingdom. 
                A well-conditioned Doberman on patrol will deter all but the most foolish intruder.</p>

            <h2>Husky</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Husky.jpg" alt="Picture of a Husky">
            <p>Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed 
                to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. 
                Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's 
                almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue'¿and sometimes one of each'¿and convey a keen but 
                amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their 
                powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are 
                noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. As born pack dogs, 
                they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render 
                them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small animals, 
                so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, 
                with little doggy odor.</p>

            <h2>French Bulldog</h2>
            <img src="./assets/french_bulldog.jpg" alt="Picture of a French Bulldog">
            <p>The one-of-a-kind French Bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the 
                world's most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers. The Frenchie is playful, 
                alert, adaptable, and completely irresistible. The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, 
                except for the large, erect 'bat ears' that are the breed's trademark feature. The head is large 
                and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the 
                smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular. The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. 
                Dogs of few words, Frenchies don't bark much'¿but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. 
                They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor 
                exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. 
                It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable 
                breed.</p>

            <h2>Golden Retriever</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Goldenretreiver.jpg" alt="Picture of a Golden Retriever">
            <p>The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most 
                popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, 
                and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love 
                of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous 
                for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its 
                friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, 
                Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers 
                say, with a 'merry action.' The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever 
                are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at 
                the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. 
                These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's 
                great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that 
                had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been 
                handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family 
                dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain 
                this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. 
                For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural 
                pastimes.</p>

            <h2>Yorkshire Terrier</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Yorkshire-Terrier.jpg" alt="Picture of a Yorkshire Terrier">
            <p>Beneath the dainty, glossy, floor-length coat of a 
                Yorkshire Terrier beats the heart of a feisty, old-time terrier. Yorkies earned their living as 
                ratters in mines and mills long before they became the beribboned lapdogs of Victorian ladies. 
                The Yorkshire Terrier is a compact, toy-size terrier of no more than seven pounds whose crowning 
                glory is a floor-length, silky coat of steel blue and a rich golden tan. Don't let the Yorkie's 
                daintiness fool you. Tenacious, feisty, brave, and sometimes bossy, the Yorkie exhibits all the 
                traits of a true terrier. Often named the most popular dog breed in various American cities, 
                Yorkies pack lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are favorites 
                of urbanites the world over. Yorkies are long-lived and hypoallergenic (the coat is more like 
                human hair than animal fur), and they make fine little watchdogs. This is a true 'personality 
                breed,' providing years of laughs, love, and close companionship.</p>

            <img src="./assets/Border-Collie.jpg" alt="Picture of a Border Collie">
            <p>A remarkably bright workaholic, the Border Collie is an amazing dog'¿maybe a bit too amazing for 
                owners without the time, energy, or means to keep it occupied. These energetic dogs will settle 
                down for cuddle time when the workday is done. Borders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 
                18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker 
                unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors 
                and patterns. The almond eyes are the focus of an intelligent expression'¿an intense gaze, the 
                Border's famous 'herding eye', is a breed hallmark. On the move, Borders are among the canine 
                kingdom's most agile, balanced, and durable citizens. The intelligence, athleticism, and 
                trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training. Having a job to perform, 
                like agility'¿or herding or obedience work'¿is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, 
                they may be reserved with strangers.</p>

            <p>The bold, bewhiskered Standard Schnauzer is a high-spirited farm dog from Germany. 
                They are the sometimes-willful but ever reliable medium-sized members of the Schnauzer family of 
                breeds. The Standard's sporty look is a canine classic. A medium-size dog weighing between 35 and 
                45 pounds, the Standard Schnauzer is truly the standard Schnauzer: larger than Miniatures, smaller 
                than Giants. Schnauzers of all three sizes share several breed hallmarks: a wiry, tight-fitting 
                coat of pure black or 'pepper and salt'; a robust, square-built frame; and an elongated head 
                furnished with arched eyebrows and bristly whiskers, framing eyes gleaming with keen intelligence. 
                Standards are sociable companions, alert watchdogs, enthusiastic backyard squirrel chasers, and 
                are good with kids and protective of loved ones. Approached with a firm but gentle hand, Standards 
                train beautifully. Owners must provide outlets for their dog's upbeat athleticism and highly 
                developed senses.</p>

            <h2>Basset Hound</h2>
            <img src="./assets/Basset Hound.jpg" alt="Picture of a Basset Hound">
            <p>Among the most appealing of the AKC breeds, the endearing and instantly recognizable Basset Hound 
                is a perennial favorite of dog lovers all over the world. This low-slung and low-key hound can be 
                sometimes stubborn, but is always charming. The Basset Hound stands no higher than 14 inches at 
                the shoulder but, with his remarkably heavy bone, powerful little legs, and massive paws, he 
                possesses big-dog strength and stamina. Bassets are famous for a large, domed head that features 
                extremely long, velvety ears, mournful eyes, and a wrinkled brow, which give the breed the look of 
                a sad clown. Built more for endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless 
                manner. The breed's scenting ability is uncanny; it's said that among dogs only the Bloodhound's 
                nose is more accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks 
                in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they 
                are steadfastly loyal.</p>

            <p>The tallest of the AKC's spaniels, the Irish Water Spaniel is instantly recognizable by its 
                crisply curled coat and tapering 'rat tail.' Among the champion swimmers of dogdom, the alert 
                and inquisitive IWS is hardworking and brave in the field, and playfully affectionate at home. 
                This tallest of AKC spaniels, standing 21 to 24 inches at the shoulder and weighing 55 to 65 
                pounds, straddles the line between 'medium' and 'large' dogs on our scale of size. Among its 
                distinguishing characteristics are a crisply curled, liver-colored, waterproof coat; a tapered 
                'rat tail'; and a cleanly chiseled head crowned with a topknot of long, loose curls. The IWS 
                moves with a smooth ground-covering gait, enabling him to put in a long day's work in the field.</p>

            <p>The Bolognese, a member of the Bichon family, is an enchanting small, white companion dog with a 
                compact and sturdy, square body. The Bolognese is a rather serious dog and generally not high 
                energy but is intelligent and witty.
            <p>A small companion breed originating in Italy, the Bolognese is a calm, 
                faithful dog with a long, fluffy pure-white coat. They are very playful, 
                easy-going and love people. The Bolognese is small, stocky, and squarely built. 
                He is rather serene and inactive, and devoted to his master and his people. They can be shy 
                towards strangers, but warm up quickly if they are properly socialized. Prone to separation 
                anxiety, the Bolognese does not do well alone for long periods of time. They would be ill-suited 
                for people with a 9-5 workday.</p>
